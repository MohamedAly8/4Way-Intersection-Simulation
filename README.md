# 4-Way Traffic Signal Simulation
Welcome to our 4-way traffic signal simulation project! In this project, we simulate a traffic intersection with four directions of traffic flow. Our goal is to create a simulation that is as close to reality as possible, allowing us to test various traffic signal designs and optimize traffic flow.

## Introduction
When designing an intersection, it's important to consider the needs of all road users, including drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. A well-designed intersection should prioritize safety, efficiency, and accessibility for all users.

In this project, we focus on traffic flow optimization by simulating different traffic signal designs. We aim to minimize wait times, reduce congestion, and increase overall traffic efficiency.

##Technologies Used
Our simulation is written in Python and uses the Multithreading library to create a realistic simulation of the intersection and traffic flow. We also use Pandas and NumPy for data analysis and matplotlib for data visualization.

Usage
To run the simulation, simply download the code and run Intersectopm.py in your Python environment. The simulation will display a visual representation of the intersection and traffic flow, as well as data on wait times, traffic volume, and other metrics.

Results
After running various simulations with different traffic signal designs, we found that a combination of round-robin scheduling and dynamic signal timing provided the most efficient traffic flow. By dynamically adjusting signal timing based on traffic volume and congestion, we were able to reduce wait times and increase overall traffic throughput.

Future Work
In the future, we plan to incorporate machine learning algorithms to further optimize traffic flow and reduce wait times. We also plan to expand our simulation to include more complex intersections and traffic scenarios.
